# BoilerDate ðŸ¥µ

Full-stack dating web application focused on STEM students at Purdue University. <br /> <br />
CS 307 Project Spring 2024 - Purdue University.

## Demo


## Motivation

> ### "What if.. CS students can also dateâ€¦" - Youngjun Yoo (after the breakup)

## Overview

Currently, there are many dating apps available, such as Tinder and Bumble. However, Purdue STEM students might find it challenging to find a suitable match on these platforms. BoilerDate is an alternative dating web app that specifically targets Purdue students, with a focus on those in STEM majors. This is because students in STEM are known for their academic strength, but are also often **introverted** and may have **weak social skills**. BoilerDate will be catered towards students who want to find their significant other, not only based on common dating app features but also on common academic goals and interests.
